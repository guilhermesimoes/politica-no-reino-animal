# Politics

A really simple site designed with the two following concepts in mind:

* [Mobile First](http://static.lukew.com/MobileFirst_LukeW.pdf), by LukeW
* [Responsive Web Design](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/), by Ethan Marcotte

Try it out [here](http://politica-no-reino-animal.heroku.com/). To see how the layout adapts to the viewport size, resize your browser window.

Alternatively, check the site through [responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/?scroll=ext&url=politica-no-reino-animal.heroku.com).

## Setup

First, install all the required gems with:

    bundle install --without production

Then start a web server on port 4567 with:

    rackup --port 4567
